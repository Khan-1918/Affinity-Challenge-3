Project Objective
The goal is to develop a machine learning model to predict late deliveries based on historical order data. Accurate predictions are critical as late deliveries negatively impact campaign performance, customer relationships, and incur financial penalties. The model’s predictions are evaluated using the F1 score, emphasizing the balance between precision and recall in late delivery classification.

Problem Statement
Business Context: Orders have specific due dates governed by the service level agreement (SLA). Late deliveries can result in:
Eroded customer trust.
Reduced campaign effectiveness.
Financial penalties averaging $700 per late order.
Solution Goal: Predict late deliveries to:
Take proactive measures, such as assigning additional resources.
Mitigate delays by incurring a cost of $300 per order to ensure timely delivery.
Evaluation Metric: The model's predictions are assessed using the F1 score, which balances false positives and false negatives.

1. Data Preparation and Feature Engineering
To build the late delivery prediction model, the following steps were taken:

Data Parsing:

Convert order-related date fields to datetime format.
Calculate the delivery duration and compare it to the SLA to define the target variable (late_delivery).
Feature Engineering:

Extract temporal features like day of the week, week number, and season.
Incorporate order characteristics (e.g., dim_team_key, order size, and priority level).
Aggregate campaign-level data to include metrics like average campaign duration, team performance history, and weekly workload.
Handling Missing Data:

Impute missing dates or categorical values based on historical trends.
Data Transformation:

Label encode categorical fields (e.g., dim_team_key).
Standardize numerical variables for model consistency.

2.Model Training and Hyperparameter Optimization
Model Choice:

A classification model (e.g., LightGBM or Random Forest) was chosen for its ability to handle categorical features and large datasets efficiently.
Training Process:

The dataset was split into training (80%) and testing (20%) sets.
The target variable was defined as a binary classification (1 for late delivery, 0 otherwise).
Class weights were adjusted to address class imbalance, ensuring the model doesn't underpredict late deliveries.
Hyperparameter Optimization:

Grid search and cross-validation were employed to optimize key parameters like learning rate, max depth, and number of estimators.

3. Model Evaluation
Performance Metrics:

F1 Score: Primary evaluation metric to balance false positives (predicting late when it isn’t) and false negatives (failing to predict late).
Precision and Recall: Analyzed separately to assess the trade-offs between predicting late deliveries accurately and over-alerting.
Confusion Matrix: Provides insight into the model's performance on both late and on-time deliveries.
Business Impact:

True Positives (TP): Late deliveries correctly predicted, enabling proactive action.
False Positives (FP): Orders incorrectly flagged as late, incurring unnecessary additional costs.
False Negatives (FN): Late deliveries missed by the model, resulting in SLA penalties.
True Negatives (TN): Orders correctly predicted as on-time.

4. Cost-Benefit Decision Framework
   
Scenario Analysis:
Assign Extra Resources: Assigning additional team members costs $300 per order but ensures timely delivery.
Missed Deadlines: Late deliveries incur penalties of $700.
Optimal Strategy:
Evaluate the cost-benefit of false positives and false negatives:
For each false positive, the company incurs a $300 cost unnecessarily.
For each false negative, the company faces a $700 penalty.
Design the model threshold (e.g., probability cutoff) to minimize the overall financial impact.

Conclusion
This predictive pipeline is designed to address the critical business challenge of late deliveries, leveraging a balance between predictive accuracy and cost optimization. By proactively mitigating late deliveries, the company can improve campaign performance, foster customer trust, and reduce financial losses.
